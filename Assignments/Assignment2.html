            <p class="article-text">An interesting <a href="https://www.ovationdata.com/how-poor-data-preservation-nearly-destroyed-a-feature-film/">article about the production of Toy Story 2 by OvationData</a> tells of how the team nearly lost it all due to poor data management. During production, they kept their assets on an open Unix-based server so the hundreds of people working on the project could access the files. Because one animator made the mistake to type the command 'rm-r -f *' in the root directory, files were starting to be deleted recursively from the root folder, destroying all of the project files. By the time they pulled the plug, 90% of the project was gone. To make matters worse, it was discovered the backups were completely unusable. If it were not for one other person who had a copy of everything out of necessity as they were working remotely, Toy Story 2 could have ended up as a completely different movie. </p>

            <h2>CrowdStrike outage explained: What caused it and whatâ€™s next</h2>
            <p class="article-text">This <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Explaining-the-largest-IT-outage-in-history-and-whats-next">article by TechTarget about the CrowdStrike outage</a> explains how the endpoint security vendor, caused a widespread IT outage affecting millions of Windows systems worldwide by pushing a faulty software update. The update, intended to improve named pipe execution on Microsoft Windows, contained a logic error that crashed systems. This resulted in significant disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, public transit, healthcare, financial services, and media. The outage highlighted the risks of relying heavily on a single IT vendor and exposed vulnerabilities in modern society's reliance on technology. CrowdStrike has since taken steps to prevent future incidents, including implementing rigorous testing procedures and phased update rollouts.</p>

            <p class="article-text">What does it take to keep your accounts secure these days? This question gets answered by Novatech in their <a href="https://novatech.net/blog/password-security-in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-best-practices">article about password security</a>. The main take away of the article was this:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Unique:</b> Each password should be different for every account to ensure security if one account is compromised.</li>
                <li><b>Complex:</b> Passwords should be at least 12 characters long, including letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid easily guessable information.</li>
                <li><b>Managed with a Password Manager:</b> Password managers generate, store, and autofill complex passwords, eliminating the need to remember or reuse them.</li>
                <li><b>Passphrases:</b> Passphrases, or sequences of unrelated words, are easier to remember and harder to crack than passwords. They should be at least 16-20 characters long.</li>
                <li><b>Regularly Updated:</b> Passwords should be changed every 60 to 90 days to reduce the risk of them being exploited.</li>
                <li><b>Protected with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</b> MFA adds extra security by requiring two or more factors (e.g., password and fingerprint).</li>
            </ul>
            With these techniques, you can be assured that your password is not your weakest security link.
