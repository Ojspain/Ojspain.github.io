    <h1>House Collection</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>For the final project I decided to continue and expand out my old <a href="https://ojspain.github.io/Assignments/collection.html">House Bible Collection</a> but with new categories of items being displayed. Overall, I added 168 new images to the collection, which made creating the JSON files take a very long time, the majority of the project even. The final result can be found <a href="https://ojspain.github.io/Assignments/house.html"> here </a>. With more time I will make the pages themselves more unique compared to each other. Source files can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Ojspain/Ojspain.github.io/tree/main">github</a>. Other than the new layout, I also added a way to dynamically decorate specific items based off if they are on the page or not. </p>
