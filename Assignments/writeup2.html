    <h1>24 Hours without a phone</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I planned my day around stuff that I wouldn't be needing my phone or computer for. Since one of my main hobbies is reading, it wasn't a problem for me to sit and read for many hours. Since one of my classes is having me read The Art Of War I sat down and read the whole thing. I did find myself frequently reaching for my phone while reading, and pretty much through the whole day. I think the biggest thing that was missing from me not having a phone was not being able to listen to music. Its something that I do every day and it was very odd to not have anything playing. It made the day feel very quiet. It was also interesting when the day was up and I got to use my phone again. The feeling of relief after getting caught up with what I missed was enlightening and scary. I think one of the readings about social media addiction describes the dissonance there of knowing its bad but wanting it when its gone.</p>
